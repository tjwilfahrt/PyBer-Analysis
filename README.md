# PyBer-Analysis using Python | Pandas | Matplotlib

## Overview 
### Our client, Pyber, has hired us to analyze a plethora of data to showcase city types, numbers of drivers and riders, as well as percentages of total fares by all three variables. Pyber has requested this data to improve access to ride-sharing services and to improve affordability for all riders. I used Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to visualize a story to inform and engage PyBer executives.

## Results
### Based on the line graph, we can see that Urban ride-sharing services generate significantly more Fare revenue than that of Suburban and Rural ride-sharers. Urban revenue peaks at ~$2500 where Rural revenue peaks at about 20% of that, or ~$500, within our four months of sample data. Ride share revenue for each Type appears to stay within a $500 “swim lane” and while Urban and Suburban rider revenue climbs in the beginning our our rider cycle, Rural ridership drops to its lowest point in our sample window. There appears to be no correlation between Fare revenue amongst any of the three rider Types. Our Summary DataFrame does a service by providing detailed insight into the numbers of our line graph. We can see Urban ridership (Total Rides) is 15X that of Rural riders across our sample window; Suburban ridership is less than half of Urban. It is clearly more costly to use ride-share services in Rural areas, which could be due to fewer driver availability. It is important to note than Rural Drivers generate, on average, almost 4X an Urban driver, which could be due to distance traveled by Rural riders. Curiously, we need to investigate why Avg Fares for Urban drivers are significantly less than Avg Fare revenue, where as Avg Fares for driver in Suburban and Rural area are significantly higher than Avg Fare revenue.

## Summary
### As an advisor to PyBer’s CEO, I would suggest three strategies to close disparities among city type ridership, and to make rural ride-sharing more affordable. Firstly, campaign and attract more drivers for Rural areas. It’s also important to adapt a model for Rural riders to ride-sharing become more affordable. Secondly, develop a strategy to attract more drivers in Suburban areas. This will focus growth in the next “ring” of service. Thirdly, Urban ridership is clearly the largest market with the largest supply of drivers. PyBer may be able to resolve strategies one and two by simply targeting more resolution through use of the driver force already in place in Urban areas. This could level the playing field for all three city types.
